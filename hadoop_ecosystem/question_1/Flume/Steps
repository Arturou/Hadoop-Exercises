Start Cloudera quick start
Open a terminal - CLI

Create a diectory in HDFS if it doesn't exist already for ex:

hadoop fs -mkdir /user/cloudera/flume/

Check the created directory

hadoop fs -ls /user/cloudera/

Go to location : /usr/lib/flume-ng/conf
Copy the attached netcat.conf
change to bin dir under /usr/lig/flume-ng
Run the command:
./flume-ng agent --conf conf --conf-file ../conf/netcat.conf  --name netcatagent -Dflume.root.logger=INFO.console

See the log being generated on the termial, wait for below line to appear

"source.NetcatSource: Created serverSocket:sun.nio.ch.ServerSocketChannelImpl[/127.0.0.1:56565]"

Then Open a new terminal 
Type telnet localhost 56565

it creates a connection to that port

Now type something " hi this is a test" and press enter

Check the other terminal window to see if you can see hdfs write statements. Once done, do Ctl+C in both windows

And now go check HDFS to see if Flume transferred content to HDFS:

hadoop fs -ls /user/cloudera/flume/
and cat the generated file for ex: 
hadoop fs -text /user/cloudera/flume/FlumeData.1525645542038
